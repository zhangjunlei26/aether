# Next Steps

Planned features and improvements for upcoming Aether releases.

**Design principles guiding this roadmap:**
- Lock as little as possible — minimal ceremony, actors can't share state
- Zero-cost when not used — opt-in features add no overhead when disabled
- Compile to clean C — generated code stays readable and debuggable
- Actors are the native abstraction — everything else serves them
- Manual memory, no GC — `defer` is the tool, arenas for actors
- Practical over academic — ship what programs need

> See [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md) for what shipped in each release.

## Language Features

### Result Type — Structured Error Handling

Currently all stdlib functions return `int` where `1` = success and `0` = failure. This works but has drawbacks: the caller can silently ignore errors, there's no way to carry error details, and it's easy to confuse success/failure when mixing with C conventions.

Go-style multiple return values would fit Aether's inferred-type philosophy — no generics or sum types needed. The compiler already knows types through inference, so a `(value, err)` pair just works.

**Planned syntax (tentative):**

```aether
import std.file
import std.io

main() {
    // Multiple return values — err is a string (or empty "" on success)
    f, err = file.open("data.txt", "r")
    if err {
        println("Failed: ${err}")
        exit(1)
    }
    content = file.read_all(f)
    file.close(f)

    // Ignore the error (explicit _ discard)
    data, _ = io.read_file("config.txt")

    // Or default on failure
    content = io.read_file("config.txt") or "default config"
}
```

**What's needed:**
- Multiple return values from functions (codegen emits a C struct or out-parameter)
- Tuple destructuring in assignment (`a, b = func()`)
- Error type convention: empty string `""` = no error, non-empty = error message
- Optional: `or` keyword for inline defaults on error

**Why not now:** Aether currently supports only single return values. Adding multiple returns touches the parser (tuple destructuring), type inference (propagating paired types), and codegen (struct returns or out-params). The `1`/`0` int convention is consistent across the stdlib today and works for v0.x. Multiple returns is the natural next step once the core language stabilizes.

**Origin:** Observed during stdlib hardening — `file.delete()`, `file.write()`, `dir.create()` were returning raw POSIX values (`0`/`-1`) instead of Aether's `1`/`0` convention. Even after fixing the convention, the underlying problem remains: int return values can't carry error context and are easy to ignore.

### Closures and First-Class Functions

Arrow functions exist but are named functions, not values. There are no anonymous functions and no way to capture variables from an enclosing scope. This blocks higher-order patterns like `list.map()`, `list.filter()`, and callbacks.

**Planned syntax (tentative):**

```aether
import std.list

main() {
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

    // Anonymous function as argument
    doubled = list.map(numbers, fn(x) { x * 2 })

    // Closure capturing a local variable
    threshold = 3
    big = list.filter(numbers, fn(x) { x > threshold })
}
```

**What's needed:**
- Anonymous function expression syntax (e.g., `fn(x) { x * 2 }`)
- `AST_CLOSURE` node with a capture list in the compiler
- Codegen emits a struct holding captured variables + a function pointer (standard closure conversion to C)
- Function types in type inference (e.g., `(int) -> int` as a first-class type)

**Design constraint:** Capture by value (copy into closure struct) is the default. No hidden heap allocation. This keeps closures predictable and compatible with manual memory management.

### Match Expressions

Pattern matching currently only works in function definitions and receive blocks. A general `match` expression enables cleaner control flow without `if`/`else` chains.

**Planned syntax (tentative):**

```aether
main() {
    status = 2
    msg = match status {
        0 -> "ok"
        1 -> "warning"
        2 -> "error"
        _ -> "unknown"
    }
    println(msg)
}
```

**What's needed:**
- New `AST_MATCH_EXPRESSION` node
- Parser support for `match expr { pattern -> expr, ... }`
- Codegen emits a chain of `if`/`else if` comparisons (or a switch for integer patterns)
- Type inference: all arms must return the same type

### For-In Loops

`while` loops with manual indexing are verbose for iteration. A `for-in` loop reduces boilerplate.

**Planned syntax (tentative):**

```aether
main() {
    // Range iteration
    for i in 0..10 {
        println(i)
    }

    // Collection iteration (requires iterator protocol)
    for item in list {
        println(item)
    }
}
```

**What's needed:**
- Range syntax `0..n` generating `for(int i=0; i<n; i++)` in C
- Optional: iterator protocol for collections (requires closures or function pointers)

### Type Aliases

Type aliases improve readability with zero runtime cost (erased at compile time).

**Planned syntax:**

```aether
type ID = int
type Callback = (int) -> bool
```

**What's needed:**
- Parser: `type Name = Type` declaration
- Typechecker: alias resolution (replace alias with underlying type)
- No codegen changes — aliases are purely a compile-time convenience

### Optional Cooperative Preemption

Aether's scheduler is cooperative — each message handler runs to completion before the scheduler moves to the next actor. A handler that enters an infinite loop will block that core's scheduler thread. This is the same model as Go goroutines and Pony behaviours. BEAM is unique in having reduction-based preemption that prevents this.

The scheduler already enforces fairness *between* actors (caps at 64 messages per actor per batch, yields for cross-core messages), but within a single handler there is no preemption.

> **Note:** The cooperative scheduler (`aether_scheduler_coop.c`) is a different concept — it's the single-threaded backend for threadless platforms (WASM, embedded), not a fairness mechanism. Cooperative preemption is about interrupting long-running handlers within the existing multi-threaded scheduler.

**Planned approach (opt-in, zero cost when disabled):**

- **Scheduler-side:** After each `actor->step()` call in the drain loop, check a cycle counter. If a handler exceeded a time threshold (e.g., ~1ms), break out and re-queue the actor. Cost: ~1 `rdtsc` read per step call, only when enabled.
- **Codegen-side (advanced):** A compiler flag inserts `aether_check_preempt()` calls at loop back-edges in generated C code. This decrements a reduction counter and yields when it hits zero. Cost: 2-3 cycles per loop iteration. Default off.

**Design constraint:** Default off, zero overhead when disabled. Fits the "lock as little as possible" philosophy. Programs that keep handlers short (which is best practice in any actor system) pay nothing.

## Quick Wins

Near-term improvements that build on existing infrastructure.

### Actor Timeouts

Actors can currently wait forever for messages that never arrive. A timeout mechanism enables health checks, retries, and deadlock detection.

**Planned syntax (tentative):**

```aether
actor Worker {
    receive {
        Task(data) -> { process(data) }
    } after 5000 -> {
        println("No tasks for 5 seconds, shutting down")
    }
}
```

**What's needed:**
- `after` clause in receive blocks (parser + codegen)
- Timer infrastructure in scheduler (rdtsc-based deadline per actor)
- Timeout message delivered as a special reserved message type

### Package Registry

`ae add` can clone GitHub repos today but there's no versioned registry, no dependency resolution, and no lock files. Starting with a GitHub-based package index (similar to early Cargo), version constraints in `aether.toml`, and a lock file format.

## Future

Major features that require significant architectural work.

### WebAssembly Target

Aether compiles to C, and C compiles to WASM via Emscripten, so the path exists. The platform portability layer addresses the core blockers: pthreads, filesystem, and networking dependencies are now conditionally compiled via `AETHER_HAS_*` flags.

**Incremental approach:**
- **Phase 1 (infrastructure done):** The cooperative scheduler (`aether_scheduler_coop.c`) provides a single-threaded backend that implements the same API as the multi-core scheduler. `PLATFORM=wasm` in the Makefile selects this scheduler and sets `-DAETHER_NO_THREADING -DAETHER_NO_FILESYSTEM -DAETHER_NO_NETWORKING`. Multi-actor programs work cooperatively — all actors run on core 0 via `aether_scheduler_poll()`. Timing uses `emscripten_get_now()` instead of `rdtsc`/`clock_gettime`.
- **Phase 2 (future):** Multi-actor programs using Web Workers as scheduler threads, with message passing over `postMessage`.

**What's done:**
- `AETHER_HAS_*` compile-time flags with auto-detection and `-DAETHER_NO_*` overrides
- Cooperative scheduler (`runtime/scheduler/aether_scheduler_coop.c`) — same API, single-threaded
- Stdlib stubs for filesystem, networking, OS operations when features unavailable
- Emscripten timing fallback in generated code (`emscripten_get_now()`)
- `PLATFORM=wasm` Makefile target (selects cooperative scheduler, disables pthreads/fs/net)
- Atomics fallback (`atomic_int` → `volatile int`) for single-threaded builds
- Docker CI images (`docker/Dockerfile.wasm`, `docker/Dockerfile.embedded`) for cross-platform verification
- `make ci-wasm` (Emscripten compile + Node.js execution), `make ci-embedded` (ARM syntax-check)
- `make ci-coop` for testing cooperative mode on native
- Cooperative scheduler tests: multi-actor state, message chains, 10-actor stress, ask/reply

**What's remaining:**
- `ae build --target wasm` CLI integration
- Emscripten-specific output (`.wasm` + `.js` glue, HTML template)
- WASI support for non-browser environments
- End-to-end testing with real Emscripten toolchain in Docker

### Async I/O Integration

All I/O in Aether is currently blocking. There is no io_uring (Linux), kqueue (macOS), or IOCP (Windows) integration. The actor model naturally maps to the submit/complete pattern (send a request, receive a completion message), but the runtime doesn't use it yet.

**What's needed:**
- I/O event loop thread(s) using platform-native async APIs
- I/O completions delivered as actor messages
- Scheduler awareness of I/O-blocked actors (don't count them as idle)
- Async variants of file and network operations in the stdlib
