## 1. Hello Actor (5 min)

### Your First Actor

Actors are the core abstraction in Aether. An actor is a lightweight concurrent entity that processes messages.

```aether
actor counter {
    state int count = 0;
    
    receive(msg) {
        count++;
        print(count);
    }
}

main() {
    c = spawn_counter();
    send_counter(c, 1, 0);
}
```

**What's happening?**
- `actor counter { ... }` - Defines an actor named `counter`
- `state int count = 0` - Actor's private state (encapsulated)
- `receive(msg) { ... }` - Message handler (runs when messages arrive)
- `spawn_counter()` - Creates a new counter actor
- `send_counter(c, 1, 0)` - Sends a message to the actor

### Key Concepts
- **State**: Each actor has private state that only it can access
- **Messages**: Actors communicate only through messages (no shared memory)
- **Lightweight**: Actors have minimal memory overhead compared to OS threads
- **Fast**: High-throughput message passing optimized for modern multi-core systems

## 2. Arrays & Data (5 min)

### Fixed Arrays

Declare arrays with a fixed size:

```aether
main() {
    // Fixed-size array
    int[5] nums;

    // Array literal
    values = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];

    // Indexing
    nums[0] = 100;
    nums[1] = 200;
    x = values[0];  // x = 10

    print(x);
}
```

### Dynamic Arrays

Use `make()` for runtime-sized arrays (Go-style):

```aether
main() {
    // Allocate 1000 integers
    buffer = make([]int, 1000);

    // Use like any array
    buffer[0] = 42;
    buffer[999] = 100;

    val = buffer[0];
    print(val);  // Prints 42
}
```

### Multi-Dimensional Arrays

```aether
main() {
    // 3x3 matrix
    int[3][3] matrix;

    matrix[0][0] = 1;
    matrix[1][1] = 5;
    matrix[2][2] = 9;
}
```

### Arrays in Actors

Actors can have array state:

```aether
actor buffer {
    state int[100] data;
    state int count = 0;
    
    receive(msg) {
        if (msg.type == 1) {
            data[count] = msg.payload;
            count++;
        }
    }
}

main() {
    buf = spawn_buffer();

    for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        send_buffer(buf, 1, i * 10);
    }
}
```

---

## 3. Multiple Actors (10 min)

### Actor Communication

Actors can send messages to each other:

```aether
actor worker {
    state int id;
    state int work_done = 0;
    
    receive(msg) {
        if (msg.type == 1) {  // Work request
            work_done++;
            print(work_done);
        }
    }
}

main() {
    // Spawn multiple workers
    w1 = spawn_worker();
    w2 = spawn_worker();
    w3 = spawn_worker();

    // Distribute work
    send_worker(w1, 1, 0);
    send_worker(w2, 1, 0);
    send_worker(w3, 1, 0);
}
```

### Control Flow

Aether supports standard control structures:

```aether
actor processor {
    state int count = 0;
    
    receive(msg) {
        // Switch on message type
        switch (msg.type) {
            case 1:
                count++;
                break;
            case 2:
                count--;
                break;
            case 3:
                count = 0;
                break;
            default:
                print(0);
        }
        
        // Conditional logic
        if (count > 100) {
            count = 0;
        } else if (count < 0) {
            count = 0;
        }
        
        print(count);
    }
}
```

### Loops

```aether
main() {
    sum = 0;

    // For loop
    for (i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
        sum = sum + i;
    }

    // While loop
    j = 0;
    while (j < 10) {
        print(j);
        j++;
    }

    print(sum);
}
```

---

## 4. Multi-Core (5 min)

### Automatic Multi-Core

Aether automatically distributes actors across CPU cores using round-robin assignment:

```aether
main() {
    // These actors will be distributed across cores
    actors = make([]actor worker, 100);

    for (i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
        actors[i] = spawn_worker();
    }

    // Send work to all actors
    for (i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
        send_worker(actors[i], 1, i);
    }
}
```

**Performance**:
Performance varies based on workload patterns and hardware. The runtime includes optimizations for message passing, cache locality, and multi-core scalability.

See [benchmarks/cross-language](../benchmarks/cross-language/) for methodology and comparisons.

### How It Works

1. **Round-Robin**: `actor_id % num_cores` determines core assignment
2. **Fixed Placement**: Each actor stays on its assigned core (cache-friendly)
3. **Lock-Free Queues**: Cross-core messages use lock-free queues
4. **Zero-Copy**: Messages are never copied, only pointers are passed

## 5. Complete Example (5 min)

Let's build a complete application that demonstrates everything:

```aether
// Worker actor that processes tasks
actor worker {
    state int id;
    state int[1000] results;
    state int count = 0;
    
    receive(msg) {
        switch (msg.type) {
            case 1:  // New task
                // Process task (example: square the payload)
                results[count] = msg.payload * msg.payload;
                count++;
                break;
                
            case 2:  // Get count
                print(count);
                break;
                
            default:
                print(0);
        }
    }
}

// Coordinator actor that manages workers
actor coordinator {
    state worker[4] workers;
    state int next_worker = 0;
    
    receive(msg) {
        if (msg.type == 1) {  // Distribute work
            w = workers[next_worker];
            send_worker(w, 1, msg.payload);

            next_worker++;
            if (next_worker >= 4) {
                next_worker = 0;
            }
        }
    }
}

main() {
    // Create coordinator
    coord = spawn_coordinator();

    // Create workers (will be distributed across cores)
    w1 = spawn_worker();
    w2 = spawn_worker();
    w3 = spawn_worker();
    w4 = spawn_worker();

    // TODO: In future version, we can initialize coordinator's workers array

    // Send 100 tasks through coordinator
    for (i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
        send_coordinator(coord, 1, i);
    }

    // Check worker status
    send_worker(w1, 2, 0);
    send_worker(w2, 2, 0);
    send_worker(w3, 2, 0);
    send_worker(w4, 2, 0);
}
```

## Next Steps

### Compile and Run

```bash
# Compile your Aether program
./build/aetherc my_program.ae output.c

# Compile the generated C code
gcc output.c -Iruntime runtime/multicore_scheduler.c runtime/memory.c -o my_program -pthread

# Run
./my_program
```

### Performance Tips

1. **Batch Messages**: Send multiple items in one message when possible
2. **Minimize Cross-Core**: Keep related actors on the same core when you can
3. **Use Arrays**: Arrays are fast and cache-friendly
4. **Avoid Allocations**: Reuse buffers instead of allocating frequently

### Best Practices

1. **Keep Actors Small**: Actors should do one thing well
2. **Immutable Messages**: Treat message data as read-only
3. **No Shared State**: Only communicate through messages
4. **Handle All Cases**: Always have a `default` case in switches
