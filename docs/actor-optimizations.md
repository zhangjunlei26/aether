# Actor Runtime Optimizations

## Overview

The actor runtime implements performance optimizations targeting message-passing overhead, synchronization primitives, and memory access patterns. Each optimization addresses specific bottlenecks identified through empirical benchmarking.

## Core Scheduler Optimizations

### Message Coalescing

**Implementation:** `runtime/scheduler/multicore_scheduler.c`

Drains multiple messages from the lock-free queue in a single batch, reducing the number of atomic operations required. Instead of performing atomic operations for each message, the scheduler drains multiple messages and processes them locally.

**Rationale:**
- Amortizes atomic operation overhead across batches
- Reduces cache coherency traffic between cores
- Maintains message ordering guarantees

### Optimized Spinlock

**Implementation:** `runtime/scheduler/multicore_scheduler.h`

Custom spinlock using atomic_flag with platform-specific CPU yield hints. The PAUSE instruction reduces power consumption and improves memory ordering efficiency on hyper-threaded cores.

**Rationale:**
- PAUSE reduces memory bus contention during spin-wait
- Signals CPU pipeline for improved SMT scheduling
- Provides better power efficiency than tight spinning

### Lock-Free Message Queue

**Implementation:** `runtime/scheduler/lockfree_queue.h`

Single-producer, single-consumer ring buffer using atomic head/tail pointers. Cache line padding prevents false sharing between producer and consumer cores.

**Rationale:**
- Eliminates mutex overhead in message passing path
- Cache line padding prevents false sharing
- Power-of-2 sizing enables fast modulo operations

### Progressive Backoff Strategy

**Implementation:** `runtime/scheduler/multicore_scheduler.c`

Three-phase idle strategy balancing latency and power efficiency:
1. Tight spin (0-100 iterations): Sub-microsecond latency
2. PAUSE spin (100-500 iterations): Reduced power, fast response
3. OS yield (500+ iterations): Minimal power consumption

## Actor-Level Optimizations

### 1. Actor Pooling
**File:** `runtime/actors/aether_actor_pool.h`

Reuses actor instances instead of repeated malloc/free operations. Maintains pool of 256 pre-allocated actors per type with lock-free acquisition.

### 2. Direct Actor Bypass
**File:** `runtime/actors/aether_direct_send.h`

Skips mailbox for same-core actors by directly invoking message handlers when appropriate.

### 3. Message Deduplication
**File:** `runtime/actors/aether_message_dedup.h`

Detects and skips redundant messages using 16-message rolling window with fast hash-based fingerprinting.

### 4. Compile-Time Message Specialization
**File:** `runtime/actors/aether_message_specialize.h`

Generates optimized send/receive functions for specific message types, eliminating generic message construction overhead.

### 5. Adaptive Batch Processing
**File:** `runtime/actors/aether_adaptive_batch.h`

Dynamically adjusts batch size based on queue utilization patterns. The system adapts between small batches for low latency and larger batches for high throughput.

## Performance Characteristics

### Scalability

The scheduler exhibits near-linear scaling for independent actors due to:
- Partitioned design minimizing cross-core coordination
- Lock-free cross-core messaging
- Cache-local actor processing

### Workload Patterns

Performance varies by workload characteristics:
- **Independent actors**: Near-linear scaling with core count
- **High cross-core communication**: Reduced efficiency due to cache coherency overhead
- **Burst patterns**: Adaptive batching maintains responsiveness
- **Sustained load**: Coalescing optimizations reduce atomic operation overhead

## Benchmarking

### Core Scheduler Benchmarks

**Location:** `tests/runtime/bench_scheduler.c`

Comprehensive benchmark suite measuring:
- Single/multi-core throughput
- Cross-core messaging overhead
- Latency characteristics
- Contention handling
- Burst pattern recovery
- Saturation behavior
- Scalability analysis

Run benchmarks:
```bash
cd build
./bench_scheduler.exe
```

### Actor-Level Benchmarks

**Location:** `benchmarks/optimizations/`

- `bench_actor_baseline.c`: Unoptimized actor operations
- `bench_actor_optimized.c`: All optimizations applied
- `bench_message_coalescing.c`: Message batching analysis
- `bench_inline_asm_atomics.c`: Spinlock comparison
- `bench_zerocopy.c`: Large message optimization

Build and run:
```bash
cd benchmarks/optimizations
gcc -O3 -march=native -o bench_name bench_name.c
./bench_name
```
```

## Testing

### Unit Tests
**File:** [tests/runtime/test_actor_optimizations.c](../tests/runtime/test_actor_optimizations.c)

Tests each optimization individually and in combination:
- Actor pool acquisition/release
- Direct send same/different core detection
- Message deduplication
- Specialized sends
- Adaptive batching

### Running Tests

```bash
cd tests/runtime
gcc -O2 -I../.. test_actor_optimizations.c -o test_optimizations
./test_optimizations
```

2. [docs/actor-concurrency.md](../docs/actor-concurrency.md) - Updated performance section
3. [benchmarks/optimizations/README.md](../benchmarks/optimizations/README.md) - Added new benchmarks
4. [README.md](../README.md) - Corrected type system description

### Documentation Standards
- Professional tone without hyperbolic claims
- No performance numbers without validation
- Clear use case descriptions
- Implementation details for each optimization
- No emojis or marketing language

## Integration Status

All optimizations are header-only implementations that can be:
- Used independently
- Combined as needed
- Integrated incrementally into existing code
- Tested on target hardware before production use

## Next Steps

1. Run benchmarks on target hardware to validate improvements
2. Profile actual workloads to identify which optimizations apply
3. Integrate applicable optimizations into production code
4. Monitor performance metrics to validate effectiveness

## Notes

- Optimizations target specific patterns; not all benefit every workload
- Benchmarking on actual hardware is essential
- Some optimizations have trade-offs (memory vs speed, complexity vs performance)
- Profiling recommended before applying optimizations
