# Aether Concurrency Experiments

**Research Goal**: Identify the optimal concurrency model for lightweight, high-performance actor systems.

## Overview

This directory contains multiple implementations and benchmarks of different concurrency models, each with performance analysis and trade-off documentation.

## Experiment Structure

Each experiment is self-contained with:
- Implementation (C source)
- Benchmark harness
- Performance results
- Analysis document

### 01 - Pthread Baseline (1:1 Threading)
**Model**: One OS thread per actor  
**Status**: Reference implementation  
**Location**: `01_pthread_baseline/`

Traditional approach using POSIX threads. Each actor runs on a dedicated OS thread with blocking message receives.

**Key Metrics**:
- Memory: 1-8MB per actor (thread stack)
- Scalability: 1,000-10,000 concurrent actors
- Throughput: ~1M messages/second
- Context switch: 1-10μs

### 02 - State Machine Actors (Async/Cooperative)
**Model**: Actors as structs, single-threaded scheduler  
**Status**: Implemented, benchmarked  
**Location**: `02_state_machine/`

Actors compiled to state machines stored in structs. Single scheduler thread iterates over active actors, calling step functions.

**Key Metrics**:
- Memory: 128 bytes per actor
- Scalability: 1,000,000+ concurrent actors
- Throughput: 125M messages/second
- Context switch: <100ns (function call)

**Trade-off**: Requires non-blocking I/O, compiler transformations.

### 03 - Work-Stealing Scheduler (M:N Threading)
**Model**: Actor queue per worker thread, steal-on-idle  
**Status**: Implemented, benchmarked  
**Location**: `03_work_stealing/`

Hybrid between 1:1 and state machines. Multiple OS worker threads share a pool of lightweight actor tasks. When idle, workers steal from other queues.

**Key Metrics**:
- Memory: ~168 bytes per actor
- Scalability: 100,000+ concurrent actors
- Throughput: 43M messages/second (4 cores)
- Multi-core utilization: Good but atomic overhead

**Trade-off**: Atomic operations reduce performance vs partitioned approach.

### 04 - Partitioned State Machines (Zero-Sharing Multi-Core)
**Model**: One scheduler per core, actors statically assigned  
**Status**: Implemented, benchmarked  
**Location**: `04_partitioned/`

Each core runs independent state machine scheduler with no sharing. Actors assigned by `actor_id % num_cores`. No atomics, no work stealing.

**Key Metrics**:
- Memory: 128 bytes per actor
- Scalability: 1,000,000+ concurrent actors
- Throughput: 291M messages/second (8 cores)
- Multi-core utilization: Excellent (near-linear scaling)

**Winner**: Best performance, simplest implementation.

### 05 - SIMD Vectorization (AVX2/AVX-512)
**Model**: Process 8-16 actors simultaneously with SIMD instructions  
**Status**: Implemented, benchmarked  
**Location**: `05_simd_vectorization/`

Use AVX2 to process 8 actors per CPU instruction, AVX-512 for 16 actors.

**Key Metrics**:
- Memory: Same as state machine
- Scalability: Same as state machine
- Throughput: 41B messages/second (3× vs scalar)
- Requirements: AVX2 CPU (Intel Haswell 2013+)

**Trade-off**: Requires Structure-of-Arrays layout, best for uniform actor types.

### 06 - Message Batching
**Model**: Send multiple messages at once to reduce overhead  
**Status**: Implemented, benchmarked  
**Location**: `06_message_batching/`

Batch message sending reduces function call overhead and improves cache locality.

**Key Metrics**:
- Memory: Same as base
- Scalability: Same as base
- Throughput: 397M messages/second (1.78× vs single-message)
- Complexity: Trivial

**Easy Win**: Always beneficial, zero complexity cost.

### 07 - GPU Acceleration (CUDA/OpenCL)
**Model**: Offload actors to GPU for massive parallelism  
**Status**: Code ready, requires CUDA toolkit  
**Location**: `07_gpu/`

Use GPU's thousands of cores for actor processing. Best for 100K+ actors with simple logic.

**Expected Metrics**:
- Memory: Same but on GPU VRAM
- Scalability: 1,000,000+ concurrent actors
- Throughput: 10-100B messages/second (kernel only)
- Requirements: NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support

**Similar to**: GPU compute shaders, CUDA kernels, OpenCL

**Trade-off**: PCIe transfer overhead, only beneficial for large scale or persistent GPU actors.

## Benchmarks

Standard benchmark suite in `benchmarks/`:
- **Ring**: N actors in a ring, pass token M times
- **Broadcast**: One sender, N receivers
- **Tree**: Binary tree of actors, aggregate results
- **Pi Calculation**: Distributed Monte Carlo (compute-heavy)
- **File I/O**: Read/write operations (I/O-heavy)

# Build all experiments

## Research Questions

1. **Scalability vs Complexity**: Does the 100x memory reduction justify the compiler complexity?
2. **I/O Performance**: How do non-blocking I/O wrappers affect latency?
3. **Multi-core**: Can state machines scale to multiple cores without losing efficiency?
4. **Hybrid Viability**: Can we mix blocking (pthread) and async (state machine) actors?

## Documentation

**See**: `docs/erlang-go-comparison.md` for detailed technical analysis

We're not working in a vacuum. Erlang (BEAM) and Go have proven that lightweight concurrency works at massive scale. Our experiments directly compare against their approaches:

- **Erlang**: Preemptive green threads with reduction counting (~2.6KB/process)
- **Go**: M:N work-stealing scheduler with goroutines (~2KB/goroutine)  
- **Aether**: Cooperative state machines (128B/actor)

Key insight: By compiling to C instead of using a runtime, we achieve lighter weight at the cost of preemption. The comparison doc covers what we learned, what we're copying, and where we differ.
