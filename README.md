# aether
Aether is designed to be fast,it's built from the ground up with a singular focus on minimalism and concurrency.

Zero–Overhead Abstractions:
Aether is engineered with minimal runtime overhead. By implementing its low–level primitives (like system calls and thread spawning) directly in assembly and exposing them natively to the language, every feature is optimized for speed without the layers of abstraction seen in many other languages.

Tailored Concurrency Model:
Concurrency isn’t an add–on—it’s baked into the language. Aether’s design allows the compiler to eliminate unnecessary runtime checks and synchronization overhead by verifying concurrency safety at compile time. This results in more efficient task scheduling and thread management.

Self–Hosting and Bottom–Up Approach:
Starting from a minimal assembly layer means that Aether isn’t burdened by legacy runtime code. Every layer is purpose-built, from the bare–metal OS interface up to high-level language constructs. This allows for aggressive, domain–specific optimizations that other languages, which need to support a wide range of features, can’t easily implement.

Direct OS Interfacing:
With a dedicated assembly layer for system calls, Aether interacts directly with the operating system. This bypasses the overhead of intermediary layers, enabling faster I/O and thread creation.

What Makes the Difference Here?
Specialized Focus:
Instead of trying to be a jack-of-all-trades, Aether is laser-focused on delivering extreme concurrency with minimal overhead. By not carrying unnecessary features, it allows the compiler and runtime to optimize specifically for speed and parallel execution.

Bottom–Up Design:
Every component—from assembly-level system calls to high-level language constructs—is designed and optimized for performance. This cohesive design minimizes the gaps and inefficiencies that often arise when integrating third–party components or legacy layers.

Elimination of Unneeded Runtime Overhead:
By integrating concurrency primitives directly into the language’s syntax and semantics, Aether removes the need for additional libraries or runtime checks, which can slow down execution.
