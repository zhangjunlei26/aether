An experimental actor-based programming language with optional type annotations and type inference. Aether compiles to C and explores concurrent systems design through a native actor runtime.

**Project Status:** Early development. Not recommended for production use.

## Overview

Aether is a compiled language that brings actor-based concurrency to systems programming. The compiler generates readable C code, providing portability and interoperability with existing C libraries.

**Design Goals:**
- Actor-based concurrency with multi-core scheduling
- Type inference with optional annotations
- Native code generation through C compilation
- Zero-cost abstractions for performance-critical code

## Runtime Features

The Aether runtime implements a native actor system with optimized message passing:

### Concurrency Model
- **Multi-core scheduler** with per-core actor queues
- **Work-stealing** for dynamic load balancing
- **Lock-free SPSC queues** for same-core messaging
- **Cross-core messaging** with lock-free mailboxes

### Memory Management
- **Arena allocators** for actor lifetimes
- **Memory pools** with thread-local allocation
- **Actor pooling** reducing allocation overhead
- **Zero-copy message passing** for large messages

### Message Optimization
- **Sender-side batching** for reduced overhead
- **Message coalescing** for higher throughput
- **Adaptive batching** dynamically adjusts batch sizes
- **Direct send** for same-core actors bypasses queues

### Advanced Features
- **SIMD batch processing** with AVX2 support
- **NUMA-aware allocation** for multi-socket systems
- **CPU feature detection** for runtime optimization selection
- **Performance profiling** with per-core cycle counting
- **Message tracing** for debugging

### Benchmarks

Aether includes a comprehensive cross-language benchmark suite comparing actor implementations across 11 languages. Run `make benchmark` to evaluate performance on your system.

See [benchmarks/cross-language/](benchmarks/cross-language/) for methodology and implementation details.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

**Required:**
- GCC 11+ or Clang 14+
- Make (or mingw32-make on Windows)
- Git

**Optional:**
- Docker Desktop (recommended for consistent environment)

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nicolasmd87/aether.git
cd aether
make ae
```

This builds both the compiler and the `ae` CLI tool. Verify it works:

```bash
./build/ae version
```

**Windows:** Use `mingw32-make` instead of `make`.

### Your First Program

```bash
# Create a new project
./build/ae init hello
cd hello
../build/ae run
```

Or run a single file directly:

```bash
./build/ae run examples/basics/hello.ae
```

### The `ae` Command

`ae` is the single entry point for everything — like `go` or `cargo`:

```bash
ae init <name>           # Create a new project
ae run [file.ae]         # Compile and run (file or project)
ae build [file.ae]       # Compile to executable
ae test [file|dir]       # Discover and run tests
ae add <package>         # Add a dependency
ae repl                  # Start interactive REPL
ae version               # Show version
ae help                  # Show all commands
```

In a project directory (with `aether.toml`), `ae run` and `ae build` work without arguments.

**Using Make (alternative):**

```bash
make compiler                    # Build compiler only
make ae                          # Build ae CLI tool
make test                        # Run C test suite (153 tests)
make examples                    # Build all examples
make -j8                         # Parallel build
make help                        # Show all targets
```

**Windows:** Use `mingw32-make` instead of `make` and `.\\build\\ae.exe` instead of `./build/ae`.

## Language Example

```aether
// Counter actor with message handling
message Increment {}
message Decrement {}
message GetCount {}
message Reset {}

actor Counter {
    state count = 0

    receive {
        Increment() -> {
            count = count + 1
        }
        Decrement() -> {
            count = count - 1
        }
        GetCount() -> {
            print("Current count: ")
            print(count)
            print("\n")
        }
        Reset() -> {
            count = 0
        }
    }
}

main() {
    // Spawn counter actor
    counter = spawn(Counter())

    // Send messages
    counter ! Increment {}
    counter ! Increment {}
    counter ! GetCount {}
    counter ! Decrement {}
    counter ! GetCount {}
    counter ! Reset {}
    counter ! GetCount {}
}
```

## Runtime Configuration

Configure runtime optimizations at startup:

```c
#include "runtime/aether_runtime.h"

int main() {
    // Auto-detect CPU features and enable optimizations
    aether_runtime_init(4, AETHER_FLAG_AUTO_DETECT);

    // Or manually configure
    aether_runtime_init(4,
        AETHER_FLAG_LOCKFREE_MAILBOX |
        AETHER_FLAG_ENABLE_SIMD |
        AETHER_FLAG_ENABLE_MWAIT
    );

    // Your actor system runs here

    return 0;
}
```

Available flags:
- `AETHER_FLAG_AUTO_DETECT` - Detect CPU features and enable optimizations
- `AETHER_FLAG_LOCKFREE_MAILBOX` - Use lock-free SPSC mailboxes
- `AETHER_FLAG_ENABLE_SIMD` - AVX2 vectorization for batch operations
- `AETHER_FLAG_ENABLE_MWAIT` - MWAIT-based idle (x86 only)
- `AETHER_FLAG_VERBOSE` - Print runtime configuration

## Optimization Tiers

The runtime employs a tiered optimization strategy:

**TIER 1 - Always Enabled:**
- Actor pooling (1.81x speedup)
- Direct send for same-core actors
- Adaptive batching (4-64 messages)
- Message coalescing (15x throughput)
- Thread-local message pools

**TIER 2 - Auto-Detected:**
- SIMD batch processing (requires AVX2/NEON)
- MWAIT idle (requires x86 MONITOR/MWAIT)
- CPU core pinning (OS-dependent)

**TIER 3 - Opt-In:**
- Lock-free mailbox (trade-off: faster under contention, slower single-threaded)
- Message deduplication (semantic change, adds overhead)

## Development

### Running Tests

```bash
# Runtime test suite (153 tests)
make test

# Aether syntax and integration tests
./build/ae test tests/syntax/
./build/ae test tests/integration/

# Build all examples (24 programs)
make examples
```

### Running Benchmarks

```bash
# Run cross-language benchmark suite with interactive UI
make benchmark
# Open http://localhost:8080 to view results

# Or run directly
cd benchmarks/cross-language
./run_benchmarks.sh
```

The benchmark suite compares Aether against C, C++, Go, Rust, Java, Zig, Erlang, Elixir, Pony, and Scala using baseline actor implementations. Results are system-dependent.

## Project Status

**Aether is experimental software.** It is a research project exploring actor-based concurrency and compiler design.

**Current capabilities:**
- Functional compiler (lexer, parser, type checker, code generator)
- Native actor runtime with multi-core scheduling
- Lock-free message passing optimizations
- Standard library (collections, I/O, networking)
- Cross-language benchmark suite for comparative analysis

**Limitations:**
- No distribution (single-node only)
- No hot code reloading
- Manual memory management
- Limited error messages
- Small ecosystem
- Breaking changes expected

**Better alternatives for production:**
- Erlang/Elixir (distributed actors, proven at scale)
