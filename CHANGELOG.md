# Changelog

All notable changes to Aether are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.12.0]

### Added

- **`cflags` in `aether.toml`**: `[build] cflags = "-O3 -march=native"` is now honoured by `ae build` — previously it was silently ignored; `ae run` continues to use `-O0` for fast development builds
- **`extra_sources` in `[[bin]]`**: Declare extra C files to compile alongside your Aether program directly in the project file — `extra_sources = ["src/ffi.c"]`; merged additively with any `--extra` flags passed on the command line
- **`aether_scheduler_poll(int max_per_actor)`**: New runtime API for C-hosted event loops (e.g. raylib, SDL, game loops) — drains pending actor messages without blocking; call between frames to keep actors alive while C owns the main thread; declared in `runtime/scheduler/multicore_scheduler.h`
- **`ae run` now accepts `--extra`**: The `--extra src/ffi.c` flag previously only worked with `ae build`; now works with both

### Fixed

- **Type inference through call chains**: `propagate_call_types_in_tree` was returning early on every `AST_FUNCTION_DEFINITION` node, making all function bodies invisible to the propagator — calls inside functions (e.g. `seed_glider` calling `set_cell`) were never found
- **Single-pass propagation**: Propagation ran exactly once; a call chain `main → f → g → h` needed 3 passes but only got 1, causing unresolved types to silently fall back to `int`; the pipeline now interleaves propagation with constraint solving in a loop until stable
- **Parameter type annotations now genuinely optional**: As a result of the above two fixes, explicit `: int` / `: ptr` annotations on function parameters are no longer required — types propagate correctly from call sites through arbitrarily deep chains
- **Clear error for `?` in expression context**: Writing `x > 0 ? a : b` (expecting a ternary) now produces an actionable diagnostic — "`?` is the actor ask operator; use if/else for conditional values" — instead of a confusing parse failure

## [0.11.0]

### Changed

- **Auto-free removed**: The experimental compiler-injected auto-free system (`@manual` annotation, `--no-auto-free` flag, `[memory] mode` in `aether.toml`) has been removed. The memory model is now `defer`-first exclusively — explicit, composable, and predictable. See [docs/memory-management.md](docs/memory-management.md)
- **Improved compiler diagnostics**: Better source-context error messages across type checker and parser; structured error codes with help suggestions

### Fixed

- **Module orchestrator**: Improved module import resolution and handling of dot-qualified function calls (`module.func()`)
- **Stale documentation**: Multiple doc files corrected to match actual implemented behaviour

## [0.10.0]

### Fixed

- **Scheduler race on ARM64**: Fixed a work-stealing TOCTOU race in the drain path; added `test_worksteal_race.c` to CI
- **`assigned_core` atomicity**: Changed `assigned_core` field from `int` to `atomic_int` in `ActorBase` for safe cross-core reads; updated all codegen, tests, and examples
- GCC/Clang warnings in `tools/ae.c` eliminated (clean at `-Wall -Wextra`)

## [0.9.0]

### Added

- **`defer`-first memory model**: Explicit `defer type.free(x)` is now the primary and recommended memory management pattern; stdlib types follow consistent `type.new()` / `type.free()` naming
- **Dynamic destructor registry**: Codegen tracks which stdlib constructors (`map_new`, `list_new`, etc.) map to their destructors — used at scope exit
- **`ae` temp directory**: `ae` now uses a stable temp directory for intermediate C files instead of cwd
- **`cmd_examples`**: `ae` CLI gained an examples command for discovering and running bundled examples

### Changed

- Memory management documentation overhauled — `defer` pattern documented comprehensively with multiple allocation, actor state, and escape patterns
- `aether.toml` dot-style module imports enforced as the only import syntax
- Windows: `ae.c` library path now uses mixed separators correctly; codegen adds `NOMINMAX`, `Sleep`, `windows.h` guards

### Fixed

- `realloc` failure handling in AST, module registry, and type inference (prevents leaks on OOM)
- Actor state init type inference in typechecker
- HTTP server: explicit free of `build_response` buffer; correct `Content-Length` in responses

## [0.8.0]

### Added

- **Windows CI**: Full CI pipeline on Windows via MSYS2 MinGW; `make ci` runs compiler, ae, stdlib, REPL, C tests, .ae tests, and examples with no skips

### Fixed

- **Windows build**: Fixed MSYS2/MinGW build failures (`NOMINMAX`, `Sleep`, `windows.h` guards, mixed path separators)
- **NUMA allocator**: `aether_numa_alloc` fallback now uses `numa_alloc_local()` instead of `malloc()` when libnuma is present — prevents allocator mismatch
- **macOS `-Werror` quoting**: Fixed shell quoting in Makefile for macOS clang strict mode
- `fread` return value warnings resolved

## [0.7.0]

### Added

- **Ask/reply (`?` operator)**: Production-ready typed ask — compiler infers the reply message type from the actor's receive block; reply slot travels with the message (not per-actor) for correct concurrent asks; reply payload is properly freed after use
- **Error handling**: `error-handling.ae` example with structured error propagation patterns; typechecker handles error result types

### Fixed

- **Toolchain resolver**: Dev builds (`./build/ae`) now take priority over `$AETHER_HOME`, preventing stale installed compilers from shadowing fresh builds

## [0.6.0]

### Added

- **`ae` CLI tool**: Single entry point for building, running, testing, and managing Aether projects (`ae run`, `ae build`, `ae test`, `ae init`)
- **Version manager**: `ae version list/install/use` to install and switch between Aether releases
- **Project tooling (`apkg`)**: Project scaffolding with `aether.toml`, dependency declarations, and GitHub-based `ae add`
- **`println` and string interpolation**: `println("Hello ${name}!")` with `${}` expressions in strings
- **`defer` statement**: Deferred cleanup in LIFO order, matching Go-style resource management
- **`switch` statement**: C-style switch with fall-through and break
- **Match expressions**: Pattern matching with literal, wildcard, list, and head|tail patterns
- **List patterns**: `[]`, `[x]`, `[h|t]`, `[a, b]` destructuring in match arms
- **Standard library**: Collections (HashMap, Vector, Set, List), JSON parser, HTTP server, TCP/UDP networking, file I/O
- **REPL**: Interactive read-eval-print loop (`ae repl`)
- **LSP server**: Diagnostics from lexer and parser errors for editor integration
- **VS Code / Cursor extension**: Syntax highlighting, file icons, and custom theme
- **Cross-language benchmarks**: Actor-model benchmark suite comparing 11 languages with interactive visualization UI
- **Docker support**: Development container with all toolchains pre-installed

### Changed

- **Ask/reply (`?` operator)**: Now production-ready — typed results (compiler infers reply message type from actor receive blocks), concurrent asks (reply slot travels with the message, not per-actor), proper `free()` of reply payload, configurable timeout via AST
- **HTTP server**: Multi-connection support via thread-per-connection model (POSIX `pthread`); accept loop no longer blocks on a single client
- **Error messages**: Source-context error reporting across lexer, parser, and type checker — errors now show the source line, a caret pointing to the exact column, error codes (`E0100` syntax, `E0300` undefined variable, etc.), and contextual help suggestions
- **Tail call optimization**: Honest reporting — Aether detects tail calls, GCC/Clang optimize them into loops at `-O2` (used by `ae build`)
- **Toolchain resolver**: Dev builds (`./build/ae`) now take priority over `$AETHER_HOME`, preventing stale installed compilers from shadowing fresh builds
- **Type inference**: Function return types are now inferred only from explicit `return` statements and arrow-body expressions; no longer incorrectly inferred from arguments to `print()` or other nested expressions
- **Codegen split**: `codegen.c` refactored into `codegen_expr.c`, `codegen_stmt.c`, `codegen_actor.c`, `codegen_func.c` for maintainability
- **Valgrind CI target**: Reports all Valgrind errors (uninitialised reads, not just leaks)
- **Benchmark visualization**: All methodology descriptions and message counts are dynamic from JSON data (no hardcoded values)
- **Latency metric**: Benchmarks report `ns/msg` (nanoseconds per message) instead of architecture-dependent `cycles/msg`

### Fixed

- Functions with no return statement now correctly generate `void` in C (previously defaulted to `const char*`)
- Match expressions returning strings now generate correct return types
- `ae version use` now actually switches the active compiler on POSIX (copies binaries to `~/.aether/bin/`)
- `snprintf` truncation warnings in type checker and codegen path buffers
- Valgrind uninitialized-memory reads in scheduler tests (replaced `malloc` with `calloc`, aligned test actor structs to `ActorBase` layout)
- NUMA allocator mismatch: `aether_numa_alloc` fallback now uses `numa_alloc_local()` instead of `malloc()` when libnuma is available
- JSON parser string buffer: replaced fixed 4KB stack buffer with dynamically growing heap allocation
- HTTP server response buffer: replaced static 64KB buffer with heap-allocated, correctly sized buffer
- HTTP server request reading: now reads body up to `Content-Length` with dynamic reallocation
- `realloc` failure handling in AST, module registry, and type inference (prevents memory leaks on OOM)

  - Manual control via `AETHER_NO_INLINE` and `AETHER_INLINE` environment variables
- **Memory Profiles**: Configure pool sizes via `AETHER_PROFILE` environment variable (micro/small/medium/large)
- **New Benchmarks**: counting, thread_ring, fork_join benchmark patterns
- **wait_for_idle()**: Block until all actors have finished processing messages
- **sleep(ms)**: Pause execution for specified milliseconds
